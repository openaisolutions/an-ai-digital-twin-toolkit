# Prelude—The Robotics Tipping Point

This introductory chapter sets the stage for the fourth edition of the Digital‑Twin Toolkit. It frames the rapid acceleration in robotics and industrial AI that now enables factory‑floor autonomy. Readers will revisit the original DevOps pipeline and see how narrative elements evolved into a technical playbook. Key motivations include bridging OT and IT practices and preparing for adaptive‑cloud operations.

*Pipeline Exercise*: Clone the repository and explore the new `/edge`, `/cloud`, and `/mlops` folders.

*Metric to Watch*: Percentage of factory processes instrumented with edge telemetry.

*Anecdote*: Legend tells of an engineer who coaxed a dormant robot back to life by singing a systems diagram aloud—proof that art and code need not be rivals.
