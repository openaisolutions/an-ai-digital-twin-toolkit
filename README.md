Digital Twin Guide
This repository contains the Python framework for the book "Digital Twin Guide". The framework provides a cohesive, well-designed, and simple example to help readers understand and implement digital twin concepts in various domains.

The project is organized into multiple threads, each focusing on a specific aspect of the digital twin process. Threads include requirements management, design, engineering change proposals (ECPs), materials management, software integration, testing, training, logistics, technical data packaging, production, manufacturing, and field maintenance support.
