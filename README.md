# AI Digital Twin Toolkit

Welcome to the AI Digital Twin Toolkit repository, an advanced Python framework designed to facilitate the development and implementation of digital twin technologies with a focus on artificial intelligence integration. This toolkit serves as a practical extension to the "Digital Twin Guide," offering readers and developers alike a hands-on approach to creating digital twins that leverage AI for enhanced simulation, prediction, and operation across various domains.

## Getting Started

This section provides instructions to set up the AI Digital Twin Toolkit on your local machine for development, testing, and deployment purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before proceeding with the toolkit setup:

- Python 3.6 or later
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- scikit-learn
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup4
- lxml
- Selenium
- Additional AI-specific libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openaisolutions/digital-twin-toolkit.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

The toolkit is now ready for use.

### Usage

The AI Digital Twin Toolkit is structured to support the development of digital twins from conception to deployment. Explore the `src` directory for modules corresponding to different phases of the digital twin lifecycle, such as simulation, data integration, AI model training, and real-time monitoring.

For detailed examples on how to utilize each module, refer to the `examples` directory.

### Testing

Comprehensive tests are provided in the `tests` directory to ensure reliability and performance. Run the following command to execute the tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
