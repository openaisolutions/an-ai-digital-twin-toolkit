User Manual for the Digital Twin Guide
Welcome to the user manual for the Digital Twin Guide. This guide is designed to help you develop digital twins for your products, systems, and processes. This manual provides step-by-step instructions for using the tools and techniques covered in the guide.

Getting Started
Before you start using the Digital Twin Guide, you need to make sure you have the required software and dependencies installed on your system. You can find a list of required dependencies in the requirements.txt file.

Using the Guide
The Digital Twin Guide is organized into several threads, each of which covers a different aspect of the digital twin development process. The threads are:

Requirements thread
Design thread
ECP thread
Materials management thread
Software integration thread
Test thread
Training thread
Logistics thread
Technical data packaging thread
Production thread
Manufacturing thread
Field maintenance support thread
TDP thread
Each thread contains multiple sub-threads, which are organized around specific tasks or objectives. To use the guide, you should first identify the thread and sub-thread that is most relevant to your current task or objective.

Once you have identified the appropriate thread and sub-thread, you can use the example scripts and code provided in the src and examples folders to develop your own digital twin. The docs folder contains the user manual, developer guide, and API reference.
