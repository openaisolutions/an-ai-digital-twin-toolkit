CAM module

This module provides functionality for interacting with CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) software as part of the
digital twin's manufacturing thread.

Classes:
--------
- Cam: Class representing a CAM system.

Methods:
--------
- load_file(file_path): Method for loading a file into the CAM system.
- run_simulation(file_path): Method for running a simulation of the manufacturing process.
- generate_gcode(file_path, output_dir): Method for generating G-code from the manufacturing process.
